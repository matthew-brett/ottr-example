# Ottr example

This is an example of using [ottr](https://github.com/ucbds-infra/ottr) in an
RMarkdown notebook.

See also the homework 1 example at
<https://github.com/ucbds-infra/ottr-sample/blob/master/hw01/hw01.Rmd>.

The exercise file the student gets is `vectors.Rmd`.  The solution is
`vectors_solution.Rmd`.  The file from which to generate the exercise and
solution is `vectors_template.Rmd`.  I use my `rmdex` library to do that, but
that's just a detail - the exercise and solution notebooks show how the tests
work.
